# Data (consider if your raw data is very large or sensitive)
# For this Zomato project, your CSVs are small and essential, so you might want to keep them tracked.
# If you process data and create new large CSVs/Parquet files, you might add them here:
# processed_data/
# *.csv # Uncomment if you want to ignore all CSVs (e.g., if generated)
